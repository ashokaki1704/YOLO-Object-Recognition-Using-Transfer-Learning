# YOLO-Object-Recognition-Using-Transfer-Learning
This repository contains the implementation of You Only Look Once (YOLO) object recognition using transfer learning. YOLO is a real-time object detection system that can detect and classify objects in an image or video stream. Transfer learning allows us to leverage pre-trained models and fine-tune them for specific tasks.
Project Overview
Objective: Build an accurate and efficient object detection model using YOLO and transfer learning.
Dataset: We use a custom dataset containing annotated images of various objects.
Model: We start with a pre-trained YOLO model and fine-tune it on our dataset.
Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP).
Deployment: Deploy the trained model for real-time object detection.
Steps to Reproduce
Data Collection:
Collect labeled images of objects you want to detect.
Annotate the objects in the images (bounding boxes).
Preprocessing:
Resize images to a consistent size.
Normalize pixel values.
Transfer Learning:
Download a pre-trained YOLO model (e.g., YOLOv3, YOLOv4).
Replace the output layer with the desired number of classes.
Fine-tune the model on your dataset.
Training:
Train the modified YOLO model using your annotated dataset.
Monitor loss and performance during training.
Evaluation:
Evaluate the model on a validation set.
Calculate precision, recall, and mAP.
Inference:
Load the trained model.
Run inference on new images or videos.
