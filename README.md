# YOLO-Object-Recognition-Using-Transfer-Learning
This repository contains the implementation of You Only Look Once (YOLO) object recognition using transfer learning. YOLO is a real-time object detection system that can detect and classify objects in an image or video stream. Transfer learning allows us to leverage pre-trained models and fine-tune them for specific tasks.
